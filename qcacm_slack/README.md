## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

        def deps do
          [{:qcacm_slack, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure qcacm_slack is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:qcacm_slack]]
        end
